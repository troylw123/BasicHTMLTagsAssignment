    <h2>Here is some randomly generated text related to the sport of golf. Reading this is not nearly as exciting as actually playing golf.</h2>
    <p>A gentle fade A scratch golfer, Time to buy some new clubs Look out a ball is coming straight for you! At the Clubhouse, Mind where the divot lands! That's a big slice The 19th Hole. Duck hook! Win the Green Jacket A controlled draw Better luck next time! Visit the golf range, Pushed to the right Good break! Roll around on the ground laughing, Arnold Palmer Out of frustration Roll around on the ground laughing, Duck hook!

        That's a big hook A controlled draw Open clubface Take a mulligan, Get your 5 wood Ben Hogan Reading the green, Short irons Take a mulligan, Mashie Hole in One! Phil Mickelson Carrying your clubs Rub of the green Look out a ball is coming straight for you! Dancing on the practise ground. Pitch and run Run down the fairway shouting.
        
        Begin the back nine holes, Cleek Cleek Fluffy lie Jack Nicklaus Splash shot To distract your opponent Niblick Begin the front nine holes, Visit the golf range, Lose your putter, forced to go home. Pull out the driver and.... Cleek.
